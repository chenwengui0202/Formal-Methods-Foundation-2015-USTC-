<h2>Course Description</h2>



<p>This is an advanced graduate course on formal method
foundations. The primary goal of this course is to provide students
with an understanding of the basic concepts of formal methods, and 
their applications in computer science. Potential topics include:
</p>
<ul class = tag>
    <li>Functional programming: the connection with logic via Curry-Howard isomorphism
<li>Constructive logic: propositional, first-order, and second order
  <li>Type theory: theory and its applications
  <li>Program semantics: operational one and type systems
	<li>Proof theory: including (semi-)automatic theorem proving and practical proof engineering
</ul>

<p>
Prerequisite: basic discrete mathmatics. Some familarity with
functional programming is better, but not required.
