F-omega
-------

In this lecture, we'll discuss F-omega, a system combined
with polymorphic types and type operators. In theory,
F-omega is very powerful, it can encode many high-level
language features; and in practice, it's very useful, as
it's widely used in many modern compilers (as intermediate
representations).


-------------------------

First, we'll discuss a system called \lambda-omega, though a
little simpler than F-omega, does demonstrate the key idea.

Let's start by recalling the existential types we've discussed.
For some interface like "POINT":
  
  signature POINT =
  sig
    type t

    val create: int * int -> t
    val fst: t -> int
    val snd: t -> int
  end

we can abstract the type "t" and thus encode this interface
with an existential type:

  \exists {*X, {create:int*int->X, fst: X->int, snd:X->int}}

Now, consider some container, say, a stack. The interface
looks like:

  signature STACK =
  sig
    type 'a stack

    val push: 'a * 'a stack -> unit
    val pop: 'a stack -> 'a
  end

where 'a is a type variable, and stack is a type operator:
that is, it's not a type, instead, when given some concrete
type, it will generate a specialized type, like

  int stack

This may not so strange to us, for many modern OO languages
also offer some kinds of type operators (generics or templates).
Consider this Java code:

  class Stack&lt;X&gt; {...}

or this C++ code:

  template &lt;typename X&gt;
  class Stack&lt;X&gt; {...}

which also make use of type operators. Normally, to use these
types, you must write the full type application, say Stack&lt;Integer&gt;,
instead of the raw type name, say, Stack.

This gives us the impression that we are doing some kind of 
computation on the type level: type abstraction and type
application. To formalize this notion, we define a formal
system on type level.

First define the syntax for type T:

  T -> Bool | X | T->T | \Lambda X::K.T | T T

we have the basic boolean type "Bool", the type variable "X"
and the function type "T->T". And the type "\Lambda X::K.T"
is a type abstraction and "T T" is a type application. Note
the correspondence with the abstraction and application in
the term level. In doing so, we must introduce the "type" of
types, we call it a "kind", this is exactly the "K" symbol
in the type abstraction "\Lambda X::K.T", whose definition is:

  K -> * | K=>K

that is, we have just two forms of kinds: a baisc kind "*"
and a function kind "K=>K". The intuition here is that the
kind "*" is used to give kind for all normal types; and the
function kind "K=>K" is used to give kind for all kind
abstraction. 

Let's look at some kinding examples:

  Bool:: *                             (1)
  Bool->Bool:: *                       (2)
  \Lambda X::*.X->Bool:: *=>*          (3)

The kinding judgment (1) specifies that "Bool" has the kind
"*"; the judgment (2) specifies that "Bool->Bool" also has
the kind "*", for it's a function type. The judgment (3) is
more interesting, it specifies that, when given a type variable
"X" of kind "*", the type abstraction will return type "X->Bool",
which is in turn of kind "*". However, not all type expressions
are well-formed, consider a type application of (3):

  (\Lambda X::*.X->Bool) (\Lambda X::*.X)

which makes no sense, for the arguemnt has kind "*=>*", instead
of "*". So, in the literature (and in the following), the
terminology "constructor" is often used, but reserve the term
"type" for well-formed constructors.

Next, we'd like to given kinding rules for constructors. For
this purpose, we introduce a kind context D:

  D -> . | D, X::K

that is, D maps any type variable to its kind, just as typing
context maps term variable to its type. The kinding rules are:

  
-----------------------------------(K-Bool)
  D |- Bool:: *

  X::K \in D
-----------------------------------(K-TypeVar)
  D |- X:: K

  D |- T1:: *       D |- T2:: *
-----------------------------------(K-Arrow)
  D |- T1->T2:: *

  D, X::K |- T:: K'
-----------------------------------(K-Abs)
  D |- (\Lambda X::K.T):: K=>K'

  D |- T1:: K1=>K2    D |- T2:: K1
-----------------------------------(K-App)
  D |- T1 T2:: K2

These rules are very close to the term-level typing rules and
deserves no further explanation.

Nevertheless to say, the term-level typing rules become complex.
The reason is that the notion for type equivalence is nontrivial
in this language. Consider this example:

  |- true: (\Lambda X::*.X) Bool

this judgment holds just for that, intuitively, this equation holds:
  
  (\Lambda X::*.X) Bool =~= Bool

To make this notion clear, we introduce a constructor equivalence
relationship on two constructors T1 and T2:

  T1 =~= T2

the rules for this relation are:


-----------------------------------------(Q-Reflexivity)
  T =~= T

  T =~= S
-----------------------------------------(Q-Symmetry)
  S =~= T

  T =~= S      S =~= U
-----------------------------------------(Q-Transivity)
  T =~= U

  S1 =~= T1    S2 =~= T2
-----------------------------------------(Q-Arrow)
  S1->S2 =~= T1->T2

  S =~= T
-----------------------------------------(Q-Abs)
  \Lambda X::K1.S =~= \Lambda X::K1.T

  S1 =~= T1   S2 =~= T2
-----------------------------------------(Q-App)
  S1 S2 =~= T1 T2


-----------------------------------------(Q-Beta)
  (\Lambda X::K1.T) T' =~= [X|->T']T


-----------------------------------------(Q-Eta)
  (\Lambda X::K1.T X) =~= T

Essentially, this is a equational theory on constructors. It's
worth remarking that these rules are definitional equivalence
for it just define what equivalence is, but not how to check
the equivalence does hold. In fact, these rules pose significant
difficulties on the type checking, as we'll discuss shortly.

The term language is of no difference:

  e -> true | false | if(e1, e2, e3)
     | x | \lambda x:T.e | e e

The typing rule takes little difference:


-----------------------------------------(T-True)
  G; D |- true: Bool


-----------------------------------------(T-False)
  G; D |- false: Bool

  G; D |- e1: Bool   G; D |- e2,3: T
-----------------------------------------(T-If)
  G; D |- if(e1, e2, e3): Bool

  x:T \in G
-----------------------------------------(T-Var)
  G; D |- x: T

  D |- T:: *       G, x:T; D |- e: T'
-----------------------------------------(T-Abs)
  G; D |- \lambda x:T.e: T->T'

  G; D |- e1: T->T'   G; D |- e2: T
-----------------------------------------(T-App)
  G; D |- e1 e2: T'

  G; D |- e: S        S =~= T
-----------------------------------------(T-Eq)
  G; D |- e: T

Most rules are the same as the corresponding ones from the typed
lambda calculus, except for the (T-Abs) rule, which will check
that the contructor T is well-kinded, before entering it into
the typing context G (a collary of this fact is that all constructors
in G are indeed well-kinded, i.e., types). There is a new rule
T-Eq, which specifies that if an expression e is of a type S, it
can be of any type T, as long as the type T is definitional
equivalent to its type S. This rule is very similar to the rule
T-Sub as we discussed in the subtying system, and they pose similar
difficulties to the type checking task, that is, the type checker
is on longer syntax-directed---we can apply the T-Eq rule anywhere
during type checking.

We can adopt a similar strategy as we did for the study of the
meta-theory for the subtyping relation, that is, we rewrite the rules
to a syntax-directed one by pushing the type definitional equivalence
checking to each "necessary site" and thus eliniminate the T-Eq rule.
A close look at these rules reveals that the only way the T-Eq rule
is significant is in the T-App rule, thus we rewrite that rule into
the following one:


  G; D |- e1: T1->T2   G; D |- e2: T      T1 =~= T
-----------------------------------------------------(T-App')
  G; D |- e1 e2: T'

in the above rule, the only task is to check that T1=~=T. However,
when we look at the rules for definitional equivalence =~=, we face
the same problems: these rules are not syntax directed. One solution
here is that we can normalize T and S in the definitional equivalence
T=~=S, and check the structural equivalence of their results, this
is precisely demonstrated by the following rule:

  T ~~> T'   S ~~> S'    T' -~- S'
------------------------------------------(T-EqNormal)
  T =~= S

essentially, the T-EqNormal rule will eliminate all top-most beta-redex
and leave only non-application form. For instance, for

  T = (\Lambda X::*.X)Bool
  S = (\Lambda Y::*.Y)Bool

we have:

  T' ~~> Bool
  S' ~~> Bool

and thus we have the desired structural equivalence relation:

  Bool -~- Bool

However, this method has two main drawbacks: first, it can not deal
with functions, for instance, for the following two types:

  T = \Lambda X::*.X
  S = \Lambda Y::*.Y

though it's easy to decide that T should be equivalent to S, but
it will force us to turn these terms into De Bruijn representations
to state this fact formally. Second, if the abstraction is a
variable, the application can not apply. For instance:

  X (\Lambda X::*.X) Bool

can not be evaluated further for X is a constructor variable.

With all these in mind, we can elaborate the above idea into the
following type equivalence checking algorithm:

  (1) type check expressions, to obtain two constructors S and T;
  (2) normalize the two contructors S and T, until both of them reach
      the normal forms S' and T'. By normal form, in this sense: they
      don't be of the form (\Lambda ...)T (but can be of the form "X T");
      in other words, we eliminate all top-level \Lambda's; also note
      that both S' and T' should be of kind *, from step (1);
  (3) compare, algorithmically, S' and T' are equivalent (it should be
      clear why this step is necessary next);
  (4) compare, structurally, S' and T' are equivalent, sub-cases are:
      (a) Bool
      (b) X
      (c) T1->T2
      (d) \forall X::K1.T
      (e) X T2
      
I leave the implementation details to the programming assignment.
