<h3>SML and its compiler</h3>
In this course, we'll use the SML programming language to 
finish the programming assignment. And the compiler we'll
use is the SML/NJ compiler. First, visit the
<a href="http://www.smlnj.org/dist/working/110.78/index.html">SML/NJ
compiler website</a> to install the compiler to your machine.

<p>
From the prompt, just type
<pre>
  $ sml
</pre>
to run the compiler, which will output something like this:
<pre>
  Standard ML of New Jersey v110.78 [built: Sun Dec 21 15:52:08 2014]
  - 
</pre>

<p>
A good starting point to learn programming in SML is
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/smlbook">Harper's nice book</a>.

<h3>What to do next?</h3>
Download programming assignment 1, unzip it and run:
<pre>
  $ sml
	- CM.make "soureces.cm";
</pre>
it should be clear from the output where you should supply your code.
